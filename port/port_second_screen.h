/*
 * Second-screen panel (AYN Thor secondary display).
 *
 * This is a genuinely independent render target from the game's own PPU:
 * it never touches virtuappu_frame_buffer / mode1_memory / OAM (see the
 * cautionary note in port_softslots.h about an earlier native-framebuffer
 * UI attempt that corrupted pause-menu visuals). The Java side
 * (SecondScreenView.java) owns the SurfaceView this draws into and hands
 * its Surface to this module via port_second_screen_jni.cpp; what hosts
 * that view depends on which way round the screens are — a Presentation on
 * the secondary display normally, a plain Activity on the main one when
 * the game itself has been swapped onto the secondary display.
 *
 * The compositor itself (Port_SecondScreen_PaintInto + the tap handler) is
 * platform-agnostic C compiled on every platform this port targets — only
 * the ANativeWindow lock/post plumbing and the render thread are
 * Android-only. That split keeps the panel testable off-device: anything
 * that can hand over an RGBA8888 buffer can render and drive the layout.

 * (the Android render thread runs at ~20 Hz; anything driving this should

 * slot, plaques preview a dungeon floor, settings rows toggle, the map
 * toggles follow/whole view and zooms into the tapped map tile,
